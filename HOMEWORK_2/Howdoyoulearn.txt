How do you learn


	My results showed that I am mostly a visual and auditorial learner. I agree with the survey's findings. I'm really at my best when I can observe others working through the task at hand before I begin. I can only get through bits at a time though before I can become competent in my craft. Once I get going and become confident in the task at hand then it becomes relatively easy to accomplish a task within a set time limit. I have difficulty reading especially tightly knit text, so it often takes a longer time for me to actually understand what is being asked compared to my fellow student. Often when I am learning a new software or ui I struggle to get a firm understanding of how interacting with it works initially. This has to do with the often overwhelming cognitive load that some user interfaces have. It can feel like I'm stepping into a cockpit of a fighter jet when I'm diving into a software I am unfamiliar with. I really do think how we learn has a huge impact on how we perceive the world. The difficultly is that everyone perceives the world differently and as such everyone learns with slight differentiations.
